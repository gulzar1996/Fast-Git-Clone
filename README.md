 Make for Linux OS (contributions whole heartedly accepted)
 
  ### Motivation 
  
  I clone a lot of repository on my system especially for viewing the source code.  At times it becomes very cumbersome to open terminal, type git clone and paste url. I know this takes very less time but only I could go lesser. Therefore to simplify the task I wrote the script. The script automatically copies the url from the clipboard and pass it as a parameter to git clone $url and using windows context it gets the directory where it needs to be cloned
